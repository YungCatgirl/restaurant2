# Le Modernia's App User Guide
Made by Kira
## Installation
Take the .apk file you've been provided, and open it in an Android device of your choosing. Install it (Note: you may have to manually allow installation of third-party apps) and open it.
## Configuration
Tap the cogwheel. It will allow you to configure your SFTP server's login details. Ask your IT guy for these.
## Getting user orders
The app will save customers' orders in the specified directory as `order<UNIXTIME>.yml`, formatted in the YAML format. You can either just read them yourself using a text editor, or create/use a YML viewer application.
## App for Employees
If you download the source, you will find a `WorkerApp.unity` scene file. Don't open this. I have no idea how it's supposed to work, I couldn't get it working.
